### Software Installation Updates

#### pgAdmin

I keep a close watch on pgAdmin development. If you experience any issues with pgAdmin function or installation, either file a ticket in this repo or email me at `practicalsqlbook@gmail.com` for assistance.


#### Windows

- **Windows 11**: Installation of PostgreSQL, as described beginning on page 4 of Chapter 1, is the same under Windows 11 as under Windows 10. However, Windows 11 has a different-style Start Menu. As a result, after installation, you will find the PostgreSQL and PostGIS folders under Start Menu > All Apps.
- **Stack Builder**: Downloading additional installers for Language Pack and PostGIS may take a few minutes. During this time, it may seem the program is stuck, but it's not.
